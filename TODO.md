### TODO

1. Wrap the oh-so-dangerous exposed 'pointers' in something and/or replace them with something less dangerous (array offsets ?)
2. Implement pure Java version - can see no particular reason the existing TBXML Java version is so much slower than the native
   code version.
3. Add benchmark for Jaxen
